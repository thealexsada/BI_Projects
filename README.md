## 👀 About This Repository  
I’m Alex Sada, a BI Developer passionate about transforming Australian real estate data into insights. This repo showcases my BI portfolio, featuring Power BI dashboards and ETL pipelines I’ve built at MVP Studio. From Mexico to Auckland, NZ, my global journey fuels my curiosity and resilience in tech.  

I use the Kimball methodology and star schema in Azure Fabric Lakehouse to design robust data warehouses, then craft interactive Power BI dashboards and optimize SSIS ETL processes. I’m also testing cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) to revolutionize BI—check my blog at [BI-mad.com](https://bi-mad.com) for more!
